# Tests

This project uses unit and integration tests only with Python files and notebooks:

 * In the unit tests we just make sure our metrics are sane.
 * In the integration tests we test that our models execute training and scoring scripts and that our notebooks all run to completion.

 ## CI/CD

 You can find build configuration files in the `cicd` folder.
